# Semi-Autonomous Train Ticket Examiner Robot (Komsary)

The semi-autonomous train ticket examiner robot is an innovative solution to the problem of checking passenger tickets and preventing unauthorized entry into train carriages. The robot utilizes advanced technologies such as vision and navigation systems, line follower algorithms, PID speed control, RFID-card reader, face detection using OpenCV vision, obstacle avoidance, and an LCD screen for easier communication.

The vision and navigation systems enable the robot to detect and track passenger movement and identify when passengers present their tickets for verification. The line follower algorithms and PID speed control help the robot navigate through the train carriages smoothly and safely. The RFID-card reader allows passengers to scan their tickets easily, while face detection technology ensures that tickets are being used by the correct person.

In addition, the robot includes obstacle avoidance sensors to prevent collisions with passengers and other objects in the train carriages. The LCD screen provides easy communication between the robot and passengers, allowing for a more seamless and automated ticket checking process.

Using ROS communication protocols on a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino UNO Micro controller, the robot is able to process data from the various sensors and make decisions in real-time. This makes the robot an efficient and reliable solution to the problem of checking passenger tickets and preventing unauthorized entry into train carriages.
